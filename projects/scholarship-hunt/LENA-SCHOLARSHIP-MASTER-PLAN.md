Lena Ference

## 💡 Pro Tips for Winning Scholarships

### 1. Apply to EVERYTHING
- Even $500 scholarships add up ($500 x 10 = $5,000)
- Smaller local scholarships have less competition
- Many students skip "small" scholarships - that's your advantage

### 2. Reuse & Customize Essays
- Write one 1000-word master essay
- Cut/edit for each scholarship's specific prompt
- Keep a "scholarship essay library" with variations

### 3. Authenticity Wins
- Don't try to sound overly formal or corporate
- Share real stories (how did you first get interested in numbers?)
- Show personality - you're 18, not a 40-year-old CFO

### 4. Proofread 3x
- Typos = instant rejection in competitive scholarships
- Have Brian or a teacher review before submitting
- Read essays out loud (catches awkward phrasing)

### 5. Follow Instructions Exactly
- Word count: Don't go over (or under by more than 10%)
- File format: PDF unless they specify Word
- Naming convention: Use "Ference_Lena_Essay.pdf" not "essay.pdf"

### 6. Submit Early
- Don't wait until the deadline day
- Technical issues happen (site crashes, upload errors)
- Submit 3-5 days early for safety

### 7. Track Everything
Use the Scholarship Hunt Pro app:
- Mark deadlines on calendar with alerts
- Track application status (not started / in progress / submitted)
- Note award amounts and notification dates

## 📝 Notes for Brian

**How You Can Help:**
1. Review Lena's essays before submission (2nd pair of eyes)
2. Remind her of deadlines (Deloitte = March 1, very soon!)
3. Encourage her to apply broadly (not just "big name" scholarships)
4. Help with transportation to ASU scholarship office if needed
5. Celebrate small wins (even $500 scholarships matter!)

**Financial Aid Office Coordination:**
- Once external scholarships are won, notify ASU financial aid
- Some scholarships reduce loans first (good), others reduce grants (bad)
- ASU has a "scholarship stacking" policy - check if multiple awards allowed

**Tax Implications:**
- Scholarships used for tuition/fees = NOT taxable
- Scholarships used for room/board = taxable income
- Keep records of how scholarship money is spent
