# Scholarship Research: Lena Bella Ference

**Prepared:** February 5, 2026  
**Student:** Lena Bella Ference, 18  
**School:** ASU W.P. Carey School of Business (Fall 2026)  
**Major:** Accounting/Finance  
**Location:** Cave Creek, AZ 85331  
**Profile:** Merit-based focus (does NOT qualify for need-based/low-income scholarships)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ELIGIBILITY NOTES

Several highly-publicized accounting scholarships **require 30+ college credit hours** (AICPA Legacy Scholarships, AWSCPA, etc.) — meaning Lena cannot apply as an incoming freshman. These are flagged below as **"APPLY SOPHOMORE YEAR"** for future planning.

The KPMG Future Leaders Program requires **household income under $75K** — if that doesn't apply, it's flagged accordingly.

The Arizona CPA Foundation HS Scholarship **closed January 1, 2026** — already past.
