# 2026-02-06 - Operational Failure & Recovery

## Critical Failure (8:30 AM)

**What happened:** Brian asked for links to three apps I promised to build overnight. I couldn't remember what they were and claimed I hadn't built anything. He had to show me a screenshot of my own message.

**The three apps:**
1. AI Agent Control Tower
2. TPUSA Intel Aggregator
3. Scholarship Hunt Pro

**Root causes identified:**
1. Memory write failure - didn't record commitment
2. Cron payload too generic - no task checking
3. No task tracking system across sessions
4. Poor verification - should've checked files before responding
5. No commitment protocol

## Fixes Implemented (8:35 AM)

1. ✅ Created `COMMITMENTS.md` - persistent commitment tracking
2. ✅ Updated `AGENTS.md` - added commitment protocol
3. ✅ Updated nightly cron - now checks COMMITMENTS.md first
4. ✅ Wrote this failure to memory

## In Progress

- Building all three apps now
- Adding kanban backend JSON system
- ETA: 30-45 minutes

## Lessons

1. **Never make a commitment without writing it down immediately.** Text > brain. Session restarts wipe context. Files survive.

2. **Never claim tasks don't exist without searching.** (9:47 AM failure - claimed 3 backlog items when 13 existed)
   - **Solution:** Created task-memory skill with automated search scripts
   - Must run `search-tasks.sh` before any task-related response
   - Recovery script available if tasks are missing

## Task Memory Skill (Created 9:59 AM)

**Location:** `/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/task-memory/`

**Purpose:** Prevent context loss and missing task failures

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` - Systematic protocol for task tracking
- `search-tasks.sh` - Search all task sources
- `recover-tasks.sh` - Emergency deep search

**Usage:** Run before responding to any task queries
```bash
bash /root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/task-memory/search-tasks.sh
```

## Thinking Mode Workflow (8:50 AM)

Brian set mandatory workflow:
- **Deep work:** opus46, work efficiently, status update every 10 min
- **Responses:** opus46, brief and direct
- **Kanban:** Keep updated (Backlog/Next Up/Active/Done)
- **Task tracking:** Move items as I work

Written to COMMITMENTS.md. Must execute without fail.
